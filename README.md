# Validated agglomerative clustering
Package for performing clustering for high-dimensional data using powerful validation methods. The end result is a set of robust labels for the cluster found. We benchmark the method against traditional datasets and attain state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous performances by up to 10%.

# Installing
I suggest you install the code using ```pip``` from an [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) Python 3 environment. From that environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexandreday/fast_density_clustering.git
cd fast_density_clustering
pip install .
```
You can also download the code and use the two last lines instead of cloning.

# Updating
